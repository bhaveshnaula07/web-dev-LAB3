# 💻 Web Dev I Lab Assignment 3: Responsive Personal Portfolio Website

## 🎯 Project Overview
This project is a one-page responsive personal portfolio website created for **Web Dev I Lab Assignment 3**.

[cite_start]The objective was to design and build a modern, interactive single-page layout by incorporating advanced CSS features to ensure the design is professional and adapts seamlessly across different devices[cite: 6, 12].

## ✨ Key Features and Techniques Implemented

* [cite_start]**Responsive Design (Mobile-First):** The layout is designed to prioritize mobile screens and adapts to larger sizes using media queries[cite: 8].
* [cite_start]**Flexbox Layout:** Used for the primary layout structure, specifically in the **Header** (for logo and navigation alignment) and the **Hero Section** (for text and image alignment)[cite: 30].
* [cite_start]**CSS Grid Layout:** Applied to the **Skills** and **Projects** sections to arrange content cards neatly in rows and columns[cite: 33].
* [cite_start]**Relative Units:** Used extensively throughout the CSS (`rem`, `em`, `vh`, `vw`, `%`) to ensure scalable spacing and typography across all screen sizes[cite: 9].
* [cite_start]**Interactivity & Transitions:** Added smooth **hover effects** (using `transition`) to navigation links, skill cards, and project cards[cite: 10, 45].
* [cite_start]**Animation:** The name "**BHAVESH SINGH NAULA**" in the Hero section includes a smooth color transition (`transition: color 0.5s ease;`) on hover[cite: 10, 66].
